\fixme{This conclusion sucks, fix it}
Measurements of differential $\mathrm{Z}/\gamma^{*}$ production cross
sections in $\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}
=13~\mathrm{TeV}$ in the electron and muon final state are presented. 
The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an
integrated luminosity of $35.9~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The measured fiducial
inclusive cross section times branching fraction agrees with next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD and
next-to-leading cross section calculations. 
Distributions of the transverse momentum, the angular variable $\phi^{*}_\eta$, and the
rapidity of lepton pairs are measured.

A search for new physics in events with a leptonically decaying $\PZ$ boson and large missing transverse momentum has been presented.
The search is based on a data set of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS experiment in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\usedLumiWithSyst$ at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$.
No evidence for physics beyond the standard model is found.
Compared to the previous search in the same final state~\cite{CMS-PAPER-EXO-16-010}, the exclusion limits on dark matter and mediator masses are significantly extended for spin-1 mediators in the simplified model interpretation, and exclusion limits for unparticles are also extended.
Results for dark matter production via spin-0 mediators in the simplified model interpretation, as well as graviton emission in a model with large extra dimensions, are presented in this final state for the first time.
In the case of invisible decays of a standard-model-like Higgs boson, the upper limit of 40\% on their branching fraction is set at 95\% confidence level, using data not included in the previously published combined analysis~\cite{CMS-PAPER-HIG-16-016}.
