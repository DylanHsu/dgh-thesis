\section{Dark matter searches}

One of the most significant puzzles in modern physics is the nature of dark matter (DM).
In the culmination of over a century of observations, the ``$\Lambda_{\mathrm{CDM}}$'' standard model of cosmology
has established that, in the total cosmic energy budget,
known matter only accounts for about 5\%, DM corresponds to 27\%, and the rest is dark energy~\cite{Hinshaw_2013}.
Although several astrophysical observations indicate that DM exists and interacts gravitationally with known matter,
there is no evidence yet for nongravitational interactions between DM and SM particles.
While the nature of DM remains a mystery, there are a number of models that predict a particle physics origin. 

A promising possibility is that DM may take the form of weakly interacting massive particles.
If these particles exist, they can possibly be produced directly from, annihilate into, or scatter off SM particles.
Recent DM searches have exploited various methods including direct~\cite{Cushman:2013zza} and indirect~\cite{Buckley:2013bha} detection.
If DM can be observed in direct detection experiments,
it must have substantial couplings to quarks and/or gluons, and could also be produced at the LHC~\cite{Beltran:2010ww,Goodman:2010yf,Bai:2010hh,Goodman:2010ku,Fox:2011pm,Rajaraman:2011wf}.
